# WordPress Theme for NHS website development

A WordPress theme for NHS-based projects built by the team at [Make Do](https://www.makedo.net).

## Update 23/04/19
We're having a meeting with the folks at nhs.uk this Friday (26th), and following that, rebuilding this theme from the ground up using the new official [NHS frontend framework](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/).

If you need to get in touch with me, you can find me on the [NHS service manual](https://nhs-service-manual.slack.com) slack (**@charlie**), or [email me](mailto:charlie@makedo.net). If you have any suggestions, please [create an issue](https://github.com/mkdo/nhs-theme/issues) on this repo.
