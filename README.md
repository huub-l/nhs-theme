# WordPress Theme for NHS website development

A WordPress theme for NHS based projects, built with the [NHS frontend framework](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/).

## Update 12/06/19
A meeting has been scheduled for 19/06/19 with the NHS Leadership Academy, Make Do and NHSUK, to discuss how we'll proceed with the theme.

Due to us at Make Do being buried with client work, NHS Leadership Academy has proposed to take on some of the initial build work, in order to get this over the line and release an MVP. Expect further news following the meeting on the 19th.

## Meeting 26/04/19
As a result of the meeting, a list of the current [NHS frontend](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/) components has been mapped to native WordPress functionality. [That can be found here on the wiki](https://github.com/mkdo/nhs-theme/wiki/Components).

The initial milestone is to build a base theme, followed by further work on elements that lend themselves to Gutenberg. Lastly, some elements such as forms and breadcrumbs may be built out as plugins (possibly mu-plugins).

## Update 23/04/19
We're having a meeting with the folks at nhs.uk this Friday (26th), and following that, rebuilding this theme from the ground up using the new official [NHS frontend framework](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/).

If you need to get in touch with me, you can find me on the [NHS service manual](https://nhs-service-manual.slack.com) slack (**@charlie**), or [email me](mailto:charlie@makedo.net). If you have any suggestions, please [create an issue](https://github.com/mkdo/nhs-theme/issues) on this repo.
